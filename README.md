**What is the Attrition Rate?**
The dictionary definition of attrition is ‚Äúgradually making something weaker and destroying it, especially the strength or confidence of an enemy by repeatedly attacking it.‚Äù

But in the industrial world, the attrition rate is a metric used to calculate and analyze the rate at which employees in a company voluntarily leave. It also calculates the rate at which customers leave a business. The attrition rate is also known as the ‚Äòchurn rate.‚Äô

Keeping track of attrition rates has become extremely important, mainly due to the skyrocketing resignation rates and even higher number of job openings brought on by the pandemic-induced ‚ÄòGreat Resignation.‚Äô Experts believe that the Great Resignation isn‚Äôt just a short-term swing in the industrial landscape but rather the beginning of a trend that will stick around for a while. 

Having a clear vision of your company‚Äôs attrition rate is vital to understanding where it stands in terms of retaining employees. A high attrition rate can indicate several underlying issues, such as the lack of a competitive benefits package or a healthy work environment. 

By calculating and analyzing your company‚Äôs attrition rate, you will be able to address these underlying issues and ensure the retention of top-performing employees.

**What is Meant By A ‚ÄòHigh‚Äô Employee Attrition Rate?
**
A high employee attrition rate indicates that your employees are not sticking with your company for long, while a low attrition rate means that your company has better employee retention. 

Attrition rates vary due to several factors, such as:

Size of a company
Industry niche and
Location of a company
A high attrition rate in the workplace can occur not just because employees leave but when a business can‚Äôt replace them quickly. Employees leaving for any reason, voluntarily or involuntarily, contribute to attrition.

Five Types of Attrition Rate
A high employee attrition rate has become a top concern for companies today. In many instances, employees leaving the company faster than they are hired is out of the manager‚Äôs control.

But before we get into more details about attrition rate, let‚Äôs look at its five types.

Causes of High Employee Attrition
There can be several reasons for a high employee attrition rate, many of which might be outside your control. For example, employees might leave for personal reasons like family requirements or medical emergencies. The company itself induces other causes of attrition, like transfers, downsizing, organizational restructuring or termination.
